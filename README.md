This is my Trial usage of GITHUB to upload/Download a chess movement program I wrote in Python
commands to remember for future usage:
1. git init - only use when setting up the local folder for git (adds the [invisible] git files)
2. git add FILENAME (this is part of the two stage process to upload)
3. git commit -m 'some sort of message to goth the commit'
4. git remote add origin https://github.com/fatboy00/FOLDERorREPONAME.git
5. git push origin master -  where I think master is the branch name.
